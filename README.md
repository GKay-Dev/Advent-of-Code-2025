# Advent of Code 2025 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2025** journey! This repository contains my solutions to the daily coding challenges from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), an annual event where programming and problem-solving meet the holiday spirit.

## About Advent of Code  
Advent of Code is a series of daily programming puzzles released every December leading up to Christmas. Each puzzle offers a fun challenge, a chance to learn, and an opportunity to showcase problem-solving skills.

## Structure  
Each day's solutions are organized into individual directories:
```graphql
📂 DayXX/
  ├── DayXX_<ProblemTitle>.txt  # Problem solving approach
  ├── input.txt                 # Puzzle input
  ├── solution.py               # Solution (python file)
  ├── solution_optimized.py     # Solution refactored & optimized for efficiency & performance
```

## Technologies Used  
- Programming Language: Python  
- Tools/Libraries: N/A

## How to Use  
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GKay-dev/Advent-Of-Code-2025.git
   ```
2. Navigate to a specific day's folder and run the solution:
   ```bash
   cd DayXX            # Replace XX with any number between 01 and 12 (both inclusive)
   python solution.py  # Sometimes `python3 solution.py`, depending on your python installation
   ```
